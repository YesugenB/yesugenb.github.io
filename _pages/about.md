I am a post-baccalaureate research affiliate working with Dr. Alicia Grubb in the [Computer Science Department](http://cs.smith.edu/) at [Smith College](www.smith.edu). I also work with Dr. Marsha Chechik at the University of Toronto.

I completed my Bachelor's at Smith College in May 2023. My majors were in Computer Science (with Highest Honors) and Statistical and Data Sciences.

_I am currently applying to PhD programs.

### Research 

My research focuses on ways to enhance a collaborative and holistic requirements elicitation process involving a diverse set of stakeholders. I have worked with improving the comprehensibility of goal models (an extension of Tropos in BloomingLeaf) and with a DSL (SLEEC) for specifying and validating normative rules.

### Miscellaneous

 I presented two papers at RE'23 in Hannover! Picture courtesy of Smith [Twitter](https://twitter.com/smithcollege/status/1717164135874429187/photo/1)

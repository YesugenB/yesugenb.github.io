I am a first-year Ms/PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, working with Dr. Yuriy Brun at the Laboratory for Software Engineering Research [(LASER)](https://laser.cs.umass.edu/). Previously, I was a post-baccalaureate research affiliate working with [Dr. Alicia Grubb](https://amgrubb.github.io/) in the [Computer Science Department](http://cs.smith.edu/) at Smith College.  

### Research 

My prior research focused on ways to enhance a collaborative and holistic requirements elicitation process involving a diverse set of stakeholders. I have worked with improving the comprehensibility of goal models (an extension of Tropos in BloomingLeaf) and with a DSL (SLEEC) for specifying and validating normative rules.

### Miscellaneous

I will present my paper, [Exploring the Robustness of the Effect of EVO on Intention Valuation through Replication](https://yesugenb.github.io/icse25-paper.pdf) at ICSE'25 this April!

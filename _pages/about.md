I will join UMass Amherst as a first-year Ms/PhD student this May, working with Dr. Yuriy Brun at the Laboratory for Software Engineering Research [(LASER)](https://laser.cs.umass.edu/). Currently, I am a post-baccalaureate research affiliate working with [Dr. Alicia Grubb](https://amgrubb.github.io/) in the [Computer Science Department](http://cs.smith.edu/) at Smith College. 

### Research 

My research focuses on ways to enhance a collaborative and holistic requirements elicitation process involving a diverse set of stakeholders. I have worked with improving the comprehensibility of goal models (an extension of Tropos in BloomingLeaf) and with a DSL (SLEEC) for specifying and validating normative rules.

### Miscellaneous

 I presented two papers at RE'23 in Hannover! Picture courtesy of Smith [Twitter](https://twitter.com/smithcollege/status/1717164135874429187/photo/1)

I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, working with Dr. Yuriy Brun at the Laboratory for Software Engineering Research [(LASER)](https://laser.cs.umass.edu/). Previously, I was a post-baccalaureate research affiliate working with [Dr. Alicia Grubb](https://amgrubb.github.io/) in the [Computer Science Department](http://cs.smith.edu/) at Smith College.  

I am currently investigating how insights from users and industry professionals can guide the development of technical and design requirements that better support youth safety in online social spaces. This work aims to inform future tools and practices for building safer, more supportive digital platforms.

My prior research focused on ways to enhance a collaborative and holistic requirements elicitation process involving a diverse set of stakeholders. I have worked on improving the comprehensibility of goal models (an extension of Tropos in BloomingLeaf) and with a DSL (SLEEC) for specifying and validating normative rules.

Outside of my PhD, I enjoy reading, writing poetry and prose, spending time outdoors, and talking about Mongolia, especially its horses.

### news

- I presented [Exploring the Robustness of the Effect of EVO on Intention Valuation through Replication](https://yesugenb.github.io/icse25-paper.pdf), which won a Distinguished Paper Award at ICSE'25 in Ottawa. 
 
- I presented two papers, [An Experiment on the Effects of Using Color to Visualize Requirements Analysis Tasks](https://yesugenb.github.io/An_Experiment_on_the_Effects_of_Using_Color_to_Visualize_Requirements_Analysis_Tasks.pdf) and [Visualizations for User-supported State Space Exploration of Goal Models](https://yesugenb.github.io/Visualizations_for_User-supported_State_Space_Exploration_of_Goal_Models.pdf), at RE'23 in Hannover!

**Evaluation Visualization Overlay (EVO): A User Validation Study**  
**_2022 SURF Abstract by Yesugen Baatartogtokh, Irene Foster, Joey Elsbernd_**

I co-led this study with my friend Irene Foster as we came up with a study design over Summer 2022, and ran a few iterations of this study in the next year. This is the basis of my [RE'23](https://yesugenb.github.io//publication/2023-An-Experiment-on-the-Effects-of-using-Color-to-Visualize-Requirements-Analysis-Tasks) paper, and more details on the project are [here](https://amgrubb.github.io/posts/2022-08-02-evo-study)

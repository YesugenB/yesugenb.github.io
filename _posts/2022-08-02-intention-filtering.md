**Implementing Intention Filtering and EVO in Next State**  
**_Yesugen Baatartogtokh, Irene Foster, Venus Nguyen, Thu Tran_**

This work is the foundation for my [RE@Next](https://yesugenb.github.io//publications/2023-Visualizations-for-User-supported-State-Space-Exploration-of-Requirements-Models) paper in 2023. I co-led this project with my friend Irene Foster. Further details [here](https://amgrubb.github.io/posts/2022-08-02-intention-filtering)
